# QSiM - Quantum Circuit Simulator

QSiM is a powerful Quantum Circuit Simulator designed to simulate quantum algorithms on classical hardware. It provides an intuitive interface for creating, running, and analyzing quantum circuits, making it ideal for learning and experimenting with quantum computing concepts.

## Features

- Simulate quantum circuits with arbitrary numbers of qubits.
- Support both Matrix-based and Tensor-based operations.
- Support for basic quantum gates such as Hadamard (H), Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, CX and more.
- Compute the expectation value of observables and sample the probabilities of respective basis states.
- Plotting of measurement results and probabilities.
- Extensible for advanced quantum algorithms.
- GPU compatibility (coming soon!).

## Usage

To run QSiM, open the Jupyter notebook in a Jupyter-compatible IDE (e.g.: Google Colab).
**Note:** `QuantumCircuit` class uses matrix multiplication and `QuantumCircuit_T` class is based on tensor contraction under the hood to simulate quantum circuits.
